# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is my simple in  project 0 in web programming with python and javascript.
This project contains the desserts in which I used child selector for unordered list to include the ordered lists.
And also I have used some properties of CSS.
   I just used the hover property to fullfill the requirements.
